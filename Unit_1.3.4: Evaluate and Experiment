1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

Identified Flaws: Right off the bat I see there is a selection bias. The sample of droids do not accurately depict the population of 
potential recruits to the imperial army. Droids are only one type of being in the galaxy, 
whereas the imperian army is made up of all types of beings from different planets. However, assuming the experiment is just 
to recruit droids, the selection bias also is in effect as the sample is made up of "captured droids" and not a randomly selected 
sample of droids. There is bias here as captured droids most likely did not want to be captured and had masters part of the resistence. 
Another flaw I see is Observer Bias. Since Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader each are delivering different slogans, 
this could affect outcome as they may have different delivery methods with the slogans.

Proposal: Have a random selection of prospective recruits, not only droids. If only interested in droids, then random selection of droids, 
not just captured droids. Also, have either only Emperor Palpatine or only Darth Vader deliver the slogans to both groups in same tone and 
setting.

2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly 
and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys 
learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable 
after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu 
angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their 
representative in the future.

Identified Flaws: I see Simpson's Paradox here. Jar Jar and Mace visit 4 friendly and 4 unfriendly planets. It would make sense that
the friendly planets have a higher affinity towards the Jedi and are more likely to have favorable feelings toward them. On the other hand,
the 4 unfriendly planets may have a lower affinity towards the Jedi with less of their populations having favorable feelings toward the
Jedi. If we look at each planet individually, it is possible that the unfriendly planets or planets with a less favorable stance had a
higher % who were more favorable towards Mace than Jar Jar. Also, we do not know the sample sizes on each planet, were the same number of
participants involved on each planet? How were they all similiar or different? There are many missing factors in the scenario.

Proposal: Look at the planets seperately, averaging the multiple planets may be flawed as they have different demographics. In addition,
even with the planets having different demographics, the experiment should attempt to have the population samples as similiar as possible.
Maybe we can make sure the same number of participants are presented to and surveyed on each planet. We can make sure they is an even
distribution among participants in species, gender, and age.

3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources 
and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally 
distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for 
HR and for IT and present the report.
