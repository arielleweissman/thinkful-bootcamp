1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
   - Two Versions: I will have a control group who will take a placebo, and a test group who will take the treatment supplement.
     
   - Sample: For this experiment I will take a sample of individuals who have reported themselves having trouble sleeping.                    50 females, all ages 18-35.
   
   - Hypothesis: I expect that the individuals who take the sleeping supplement will experience an uninterrupted sleep.
   
   - Outcome: To monitor this experiment, I will monitor my subject's sleep with a sleeping device. I will conduct my study for 2 weeks.                 My key metric is the number of times individuals wakes up during their sleep.
   
   - Other measured variables: The duration of individuals sleep, the amount of time it takes them to initially fall asleep, and if                                      individual wakes up during sleep, the amount of time it takes them to fall back asleep.

2. Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
   For this experiment, I will assume this gym has multiple location's within close proximity to one another. I will choose two locations.
   - Two Versions: Location 1 will have employees wear uniforms, Location 2 will have not have employees wear uniforms.
   
   - Sample: Prospective gym members. To pique interest, I will advertise gym memberships and offer an incentive for those who come in for
             an information session. Study will be conducted for 2 months during off peak season.
   
   - Hypothesis: I expect that uniforms will increase sign ups.
   
   - Outcome: I will track number of sign ups and non sign ups at both gyms for both inidividuals who come in for information session and
              those who do not. I will also conduct a survey, asking all individuals (those who sign up and those who do not) which will
              ask what factors influenced their decision to sign up or to not.
   
   - Other measurable variables: Retention rate. As an additional study, I can measure retention rate for 2 months following sign up.
                                 I will have employees at Location 1 stop wearing uniforms after initial study, and have employees at
                                 Location 2 begin to wear uniforms. In the additional 2 month period, I will measure retention rate of
                                 those individual's who signed up during initial study.
