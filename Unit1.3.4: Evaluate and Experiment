1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

Identified Flaws: Right off the bat I see there is a selection bias. The sample of droids do not accurately depict the population of potential recruits to the imperial army. Droids are only one type of being in the galaxy, whereas the imperian army is made up of all types of beings from different planets. However, assuming the experiment is just to recruit droids, the selection bias also is in effect as the sample is made up of "captured droids" and not a randomly selected sample of droids. There is bias here as captured droids most likely did not want to be captured and had masters part of the resistence. Another flaw I see is Observer Bias. Since Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader each are delivering different slogans, this could affect outcome as they may have different delivery methods with the slogans.

Proposal: Have a random selection of prospective recruits, not only droids. If only interested in droids, then random selection of droids, not just captured droids. Also, have either only Emperor Palpatine or only Darth Vader deliver the slogans to both groups in same tone and setting.
