1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

Identified Flaws: Right off the bat I see there is a selection bias. The sample of droids do not accurately depict the population of 
potential recruits to the imperial army. Droids are only one type of being in the galaxy, 
whereas the imperian army is made up of all types of beings from different planets. However, assuming the experiment is just 
to recruit droids, the selection bias also is in effect as the sample is made up of "captured droids" and not a randomly selected 
sample of droids. There is bias here as captured droids most likely did not want to be captured and had masters part of the resistence. 
Another flaw I see is Observer Bias. Since Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader each are delivering different slogans, 
this could affect outcome as they may have different delivery methods with the slogans.

Proposal: Have a random selection of prospective recruits, not only droids. If only interested in droids, then random selection of droids, 
not just captured droids. Also, have either only Emperor Palpatine or only Darth Vader deliver the slogans to both groups in same tone and 
setting.

2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly 
and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys 
learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable 
after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu 
angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their 
representative in the future.

Identified Flaws: I see Simpson's Paradox here. Jar Jar and Mace visit 4 friendly and 4 unfriendly planets. It would make sense that
the friendly planets have a higher affinity towards the Jedi and are more likely to have favorable feelings toward them. On the other hand,
the 4 unfriendly planets may have a lower affinity towards the Jedi with less of their populations having favorable feelings toward the
Jedi. If we look at each planet individually, it is possible that the unfriendly planets or planets with a less favorable stance had a
higher % who were more favorable towards Mace than Jar Jar. Also, we do not know the sample sizes on each planet, were the same number of
participants involved on each planet? How were they all similiar or different? There are many missing factors in the scenario.

Proposal: Look at the planets seperately, averaging the multiple planets may be flawed as they have different demographics. In addition,
even with the planets having different demographics, the experiment should attempt to have the population samples as similiar as possible.
Maybe we can make sure the same number of participants are presented to and surveyed on each planet. We can make sure they is an even
distribution among participants in species, gender, and age.

3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources 
and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally 
distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for 
HR and for IT and present the report.

Identified Flaws: Again, I see Simpson's Paradox when averaging job satisfaction across all countries. Job satisfaction is going to
differ by country and worksite as there are many factors in the country and workplace that can contribute to employee job satisfaction.
Averaging all countries does not account for differences in demographics among all 5 countries. The comparison from HR and IT is also
flawed as HR jobs consist mainly in 3 countries, thus, employee satisfaction cannot be averaged as HR jobs are more heavily weighted
in 3 countries. There can also be differences in the operation of each worksite which can directly affect job satisfaction.

Proposal: Calculate job satisfaction by country and limit this to the 3 countries in which HR is concentrated to compare the two
job types. For the 2 countries that do not have HR, I will compare the results of IT job satisfaction in those 2 countries to IT job
satisfaction in the 3 countries with HR. This will solely focus on IT job satisfcation across all 5 countries.

4. When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of 
physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they 
tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.


Identified Flaws: Selection/sampling bias exists as we are unsure of how physically active participants were prior to installing the
app. It is likely that those who would choose to install the app would want to track their level of physical activity, meaning they
are already physically active.

Proposal: Have 'opt-in' be mandatory for all users who install the app. Also, conduct an experiment with a sample of indivuals evenly
distributed in being physically active and those who are not and then study their use of the app.

5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of 
Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. 
When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or 
Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

Identified Flaws: The three versions of the tests were not randomly distributed, and instead were assigned based on the arrival of each
student to the classroom. The teacher cannot control the experiment as it is possible that the students who took version B were her
higher performing students.

Proposal: The teach should randomize the tests among the academic levels of her students.
