We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model?

I can then classify them based on their likelihood to pay on time. There are variety of factors which could influence a card holder to pay their bill on time. This type of model is useful in trying to understand the relationship of these factors on the outcome variable."
