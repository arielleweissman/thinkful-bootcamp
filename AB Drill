1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
   - Two Versions: I will have a control group who will take a placebo, and a test group who will take the treatment supplement.
     
   - Sample: For this experiment I will take a sample of individuals who have reported themselves having trouble sleeping. 50 Males,                    50 females, all ages 18-35.
   
   - Hypothesis: I expect that the individuals who take the sleeping supplement will experience an uninterrupted sleep.
   
   - Outcome: To monitor this experiment, I will monitor my subject's sleep with a sleeping device. I will conduct my study for 2 weeks.                 My key metric is the number of times individuals wakes up during their sleep.
   
   - Other measured variables: The duration of individuals sleep, the amount of time it takes them to initially fall asleep, and if                                      individual wakes up during sleep, the amount of time it takes them to fall back asleep.
