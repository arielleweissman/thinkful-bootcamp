Sith Lord Slogan Experiment.

The Problem - How to increase conversion to the dark side? Lack of conversion leaves the potential risk of recruits joining the resistence 
and sharing possible information learned with them. After the experiment, droids who did not convert stated that "Darth Vader forgot the 
slogan" and that "They were captured from a Jedi Master and highly oppose the resistence and the term 'Anger' only triggered more
anger".

The Potential Solution - Using the slogan "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy" will increase conversion by 20%, appealing to droids' inherent
desier to be apart of something, and serve a bigger force.

The Method Of Testing The Solution - Select a sample of randomly selected droids throughout the galaxy (not limited to only captured 
droids), and deliver the slogan  every 2 weeks for 2 months to the exact same number of droids (50 droids each time). 

Palpatine and Vader will each present one of the two slogans to groups of 25 droids each time. They will switch slogans after each 
conducted study and we will compared conversion rates based on slogan and presenter.

If conversion for each presenter and each slogan does not differ we can reasonably conclude that the presenter does not impact conversion. 
If conversion for the slogan "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy" increases conversion by 20% (compared to recruitment results from last 
year) then I can conclude that the slogan is effective. If conversion is within 1 standard deviation by the end of the study, conduct for 
4 more weeks, before deciding.
